This problem was recently asked by [**Google**](https://www.google.com).

Given a _list of numbers_ and a number _k_, return whether any two 
numbers from the list add up to _k_.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and _k_ of `17`, return `true` 
since `10 + 7` is `17`.

**Bonus**: Can you do this in one pass?
